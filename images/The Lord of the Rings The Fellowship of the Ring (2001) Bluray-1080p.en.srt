1
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:37,653
Female voice:
The world is changed.

2
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,781
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:44,451
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:49,039
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,416
Much that once was...

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,126
Is lost.

7
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:56,838
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:14,147
It began with the forging
of the great rings.

9
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:16,358
Three were given to the elves:

10
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,279
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,407
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:28,579
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,372
And nine...

14
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:33,584
Nine rings were gifted
to the race of men...

15
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:37,546
Who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:43,885
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:48,557
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,892
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,314
In the land of mordor,
in the fires of mount doom...

20
00:01:55,731 --> 00:02:00,277
The dark lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,529
To control all others.

22
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:06,700
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:11,038
And his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:15,876
One ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,462
One by one...

26
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:23,342
The free lands of middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

27
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:26,511
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,725
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of mordor.

29
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,480
And on the slopes of mount doom, they
fought for the freedom of middle-earth.

30
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:09,429
Victory was near.

31
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:15,936
But the power of the ring...

32
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,188
Could not be undone.

33
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,798
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,384
When all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:51,638
That isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:29,217
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,351
The ring passed to isildur...

38
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:42,689
Who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:45,609
But the hearts of men...

40
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,236
Are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:53,116
And the ring of power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:20,936
It betrayed isildur...

43
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,190
To his death.

44
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:33,323
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,784
Were lost.

46
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,912
History became legend...

47
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,122
Legend became myth.

48
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,167
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:48,004
The ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,466
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:55,262
It ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:56,596 --> 00:06:01,434
My precious.

53
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:04,271
Female voice: The ring came
to the creature gollum...

54
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:08,316
Who took it deep into the tunnels
of the misty mountains.

55
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,486
And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,864
It came to me.

57
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:18,493
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:23,331
My precious.

59
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,463
Female voice: The ring brought
to gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:34,509
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:39,306
And in the gloom of gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,684
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:45,854
Rumor grew of a shadow in the east...

64
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,857
Whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,360
And the ring of power perceived...

66
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,280
Its time had now come.

67
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,368
It abandoned gollum.

68
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:05,540
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:11,046
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,297
What's this?

71
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,924
Female voice: A hobbit.

72
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,885
Bilbo Baggins of the shire.

73
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,845
A ring.

74
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,847
Losfl

75
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,145
my precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,564
Female voice:
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:34,986
When hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,869
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,204
In the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,041
By shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:54,130
Bag end, bagshot row, hobbiton,
westfarthing...

82
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,925
The shire...

83
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:07,852
The third age of this world.

84
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:23,410
There and back again:

85
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,456
By bilbo Baggins.

86
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,175
Where to begin?

87
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:41,511
Ah, yes...

88
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,684
"Concerning...

89
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:55,233
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four farthings of the shire...

90
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,402
For many hundreds of years...

91
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,572
Quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

92
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:03,867
By the world of the big folk.

93
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,914
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

94
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:13,251
Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

95
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,464
Being neither renowned
as great warriors...

96
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:21,801
Nor counted among the very wise.

97
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:29,184
Frodo! Someone at the door.

98
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,937
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

99
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:37,650
That hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

100
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,236
A rather unfair observation...

101
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,074
As we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

102
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,202
And the smoking of pipe-weed.

103
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,538
But where our hearts truly lie...

104
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,832
Is in peace and quiet...

105
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,710
And good, tilled earth.

106
00:09:55,794 --> 00:10:01,049
For all hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

107
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:08,681
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

108
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:14,020
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

109
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:20,485
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

110
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:27,867
Frodo, the door!

111
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:32,984
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

112
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:44,884
Male voice:
Down from the door where it began

113
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:53,393
And I must follow if! Can

114
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:58,481
the road goes ever on and on

115
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:02,277
down from the door where it began

116
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,365
now far ahead the road has gone

117
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,786
- and I must follow if! Can
- you're late.

118
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:18,877
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

119
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:24,299
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

120
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:38,771
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

121
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:46,321
You didn't think I'd miss
your uncle bilbo's birthday?

122
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:50,158
How is the old rascal?

123
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:54,287
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

124
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,873
You know bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

125
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:59,042
Well, that should please him.

126
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,002
Half the shire's been invited.

127
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:03,922
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

128
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,428
And so life in the shire goes on...

129
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,681
Very much as it has
this past age...

130
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:19,395
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

131
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,439
If it comes at all.

132
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,194
For things are made to endure
in the shire...

133
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,822
Passing from one generation
to the next.

134
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,245
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the hill...

135
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:36,704
In bag end.

136
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:42,335
And there always will be.

137
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:46,381
To tell you the truth,
bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

138
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,009
I mean, more than usual.

139
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,971
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

140
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:58,685
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

141
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:13,032
Where's it gone?

142
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,894
He's up to something.

143
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,613
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

144
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,490
But I know you have something
to do with it.

145
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:55,825
Good gracious me.

146
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:58,953
Before you came along, we bagginses
were very well thought of.

147
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,079
Indeed.

148
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,582
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

149
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:09,130
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

150
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:12,925
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

151
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,096
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

152
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,432
Oh, really?

153
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,023
Gandalf! Gandalf!

154
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:34,512
Female hobbit 1:
Fireworks, Gandalf!

155
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,036
Female hobbit 2: Gandalf!
Male hobbit: Fireworks, Gandalf!

156
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:04,602
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

157
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:10,817
So am I.

158
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,462
Whoa, whoa.

159
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:44,225
No, thank you!

160
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:48,396
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

161
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,024
And what about very old friends?

162
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,075
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

163
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,372
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

164
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:10,126
You haven't aged a day.

165
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:18,759
Come on, come in!

166
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,345
Welcome, welcome.

167
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:25,057
Oh, here we are.

168
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:29,228
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

169
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:33,232
I've got a few bottles
of the old winyard left. 1296.

170
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:37,403
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

171
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:43,117
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

172
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,912
Just tea, thank you.

173
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:52,126
Oh!

174
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,920
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

175
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,423
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

176
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:02,970
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

177
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:06,432
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

178
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:10,603
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

179
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,316
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

180
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,277
I've just found some sponge cake.

181
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,677
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

182
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,955
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

183
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:32,500
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

184
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,526
Female hobbit:
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

185
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:37,213
I'm not at home!

186
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,846
It's the sackville-bagginses.

187
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,099
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

188
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,352
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

189
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:54,373
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

190
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,315
Never giving me a moment's peace.

191
00:17:57,108 --> 00:18:00,695
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

192
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:05,366
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

193
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:09,537
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

194
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,956
All the arrangements are made.

195
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,501
Oh, thank you.

196
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,379
Frodo suspects something.

197
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,007
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

198
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,843
Not some blockheaded bracegirdle
from hardbottle.

199
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:27,179
You will tell him, won't you?

200
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,141
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

201
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:33,853
I know.

202
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:39,525
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

203
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:43,654
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the shire.

204
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:47,575
The woods, the fields.

205
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:50,036
Little rivers.

206
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,209
I am old, Gandalf.

207
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:03,883
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

208
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,596
I feel thin.

209
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,389
Sort of stretched...

210
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:15,102
Like butter scraped
over too much bread.

211
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:19,774
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

212
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:23,194
And I don't expect I shall return.

213
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:28,574
In fact, I mean not to.

214
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:35,373
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the southfarthing.

215
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:55,309
Gandalf, my old friend...

216
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:58,270
This will be a night to remember.

217
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,128
Hello, hello.

218
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:26,465
Fatty bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

219
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:30,094
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

220
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:36,267
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

221
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,103
Go on!

222
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,990
So there I was...

223
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:55,369
At the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

224
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,538
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

225
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,207
About how they were
going to cook us.

226
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:05,337
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

227
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:10,009
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

228
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:13,679
That the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

229
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,183
And turned them all to stone!

230
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,856
Quickly.

231
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:30,029
Up they go!

232
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,200
No, the big one.

233
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,253
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

234
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,380
Are all these children yours?

235
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:51,509
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

236
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:54,845
Female hobbit: Bilbo?

237
00:21:56,555 --> 00:21:58,224
Sackville-bagginses!

238
00:21:58,474 --> 00:21:59,558
Quickly, hide!

239
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,570
Thank you, my boy.

240
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:15,491
You're a good lad, Frodo.

241
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,578
I'm very selfish, you know.

242
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:23,457
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

243
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,936
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

244
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,545
But it wasn't out of charity.

245
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:29,755
I think it was because...

246
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,216
Of all my numerous relations...

247
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:36,011
You were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

248
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,138
Bilbo, have you been
at the gaffer's home brew?

249
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:42,977
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

250
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,397
The point is, Frodo...

251
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:51,443
You'll be all right.

252
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,991
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

253
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:58,659
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

254
00:22:58,742 --> 00:23:00,286
This was your idea.

255
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:21,682
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

256
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:25,144
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

257
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:42,328
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

258
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:48,125
Meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took.

259
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,127
I might've known.

260
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:58,093
Female hobbit: Speech, bilbo!

261
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,387
Male hobbit: Speech!

262
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,597
Speech!

263
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:09,146
My dear bagginses and boffins...

264
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,191
Tooks and brandybucks...

265
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:14,902
Grubbs, chubbs...

266
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,070
Hornblowers...

267
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:18,864
Bolgers...

268
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,908
Bracegirdles...

269
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,661
- And proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

270
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,999
Today is my 111th birthday!

271
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:32,419
Happy birthday!

272
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:36,882
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

273
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,885
Such excellent
and admirable hobbits.

274
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:43,597
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

275
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:48,352
And I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

276
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:53,482
I, uh—...

277
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,698
I have things to do.

278
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,206
I've put this off far too long.

279
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:17,006
I regret to announce this is the end!

280
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:19,341
I'm going now.

281
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:23,345
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

282
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:26,932
Good bye.

283
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:03,343
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

284
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:06,930
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

285
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:12,186
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

286
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,563
It was just a bit of fun.

287
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:18,400
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

288
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:23,363
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

289
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:26,283
As often as I can spare them.

290
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:29,661
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

291
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:33,123
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

292
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:37,628
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

293
00:26:38,712 --> 00:26:41,673
No. Wait, it's...

294
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:46,845
Here in my pocket.

295
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,728
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

296
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:59,858
Yet, after all, why not?

297
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:06,323
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

298
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,992
Is that so hard?

299
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:10,452
Well, no.

300
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,373
And yes.

301
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,378
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

302
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,421
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

303
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:25,801
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

304
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,053
It's mine.

305
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,807
My own.

306
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:36,186
- My precious.
- Precious?

307
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,273
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

308
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:42,067
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

309
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:44,903
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

310
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:48,073
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

311
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:52,411
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

312
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:56,331
I am not trying to Rob you.

313
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:03,088
I'm trying to help you.

314
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:14,892
All your long years,
we've been friends.

315
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:17,436
Trust me as you once did.

316
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,106
Let it go.

317
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,651
You're right, Gandalf.

318
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:29,448
The ring must go to Frodo.

319
00:28:30,782 --> 00:28:33,827
It's late. The road is long.

320
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:36,455
Yes, it is time.

321
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:44,296
The ring is still in your pocket.

322
00:29:18,997 --> 00:29:22,000
I've thought up an ending for my book:

323
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:28,715
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

324
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,302
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

325
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:34,805
Goodbye, Gandalf.

326
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:40,185
Goodbye, dear bilbo.

327
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:52,197
The road goes ever on and on

328
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,119
until our next meeting.

329
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:28,233
It's mine. My own.

330
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:31,778
My precious.

331
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:44,916
My precious.

332
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,795
Precious.

333
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:51,506
He's gone, hasn't he?

334
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:57,304
He talked for so long about leaving...

335
00:30:57,554 --> 00:31:00,265
I didn't think he'd really do it.

336
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:16,573
Bilbo's ring.

337
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:19,326
He's gone to stay with the elves.

338
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,579
He's left you bag end.

339
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,794
Along with all his possessions.

340
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:31,797
The ring is yours now.

341
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:37,969
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

342
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,430
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

343
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:44,810
- —Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

344
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:48,313
I don't understand.

345
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,323
Keep it secret.

346
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,200
Keep it safe.

347
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:37,362
Shire!

348
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:40,824
Baggins!

349
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:32,334
"The year 3434 of the second age.

350
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:36,963
Here follows the account of isildur,
high king of gondor...

351
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:40,759
And the finding
of the ring of power."

352
00:33:44,262 --> 00:33:46,139
"It has come to me.

353
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:49,809
The one ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

354
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:53,480
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

355
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:57,484
For I will risk
no hurt to the ring.

356
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:00,111
It is precious to me...

357
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:03,615
Though I buy it with great pain.

358
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:10,956
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

359
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:15,961
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

360
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:20,257
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

361
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:41,945
Baggins.

362
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:46,491
There's no bagginses around here.
They're all up in hobbiton.

363
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,661
That way.

364
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,919
To heal my heart and drown my woe

365
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:00,422
rain may fall and wind may blow

366
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,217
many miles to go

367
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,344
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

368
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:08,722
and the stream that falls
from hill to plain

369
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:10,724
better than rain or rippling brook

370
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:13,268
is a mug of beer inside this took

371
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:19,524
there's been some strange folk
crossing the shire.

372
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:23,820
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

373
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:25,697
War is brewing.

374
00:35:26,364 --> 00:35:29,284
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

375
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,078
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

376
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:36,750
You're beginning to sound like that old
bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

377
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,919
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

378
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:41,546
And proud of it.

379
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,965
- Cheers, gaffer.
- Cheers.

380
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:48,261
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

381
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:52,724
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

382
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,313
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

383
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:02,984
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

384
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:05,570
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

385
00:36:05,654 --> 00:36:10,241
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

386
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:12,410
Does she?

387
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:16,081
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

388
00:36:40,855 --> 00:36:43,358
Is it secret? Is it safe?

389
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:54,369
What are you doing?

390
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,509
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

391
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:10,802
It's quite cool.

392
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:16,141
What can you see?

393
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:20,311
Can you see anything?

394
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:24,482
Nothing.

395
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:27,110
There's nothing.

396
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,654
Wait.

397
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,994
There are markings.

398
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:40,999
It's some form of elvish.
I can't read it.

399
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:43,668
There are few who can.

400
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:49,048
The language is that of mordor,
which I will not utter here.

401
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:53,094
In the common tongue, it says:

402
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:56,723
"One ring to rule them all...

403
00:37:57,015 --> 00:37:59,392
One ring to find them...

404
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,686
One ring to bring them all...

405
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,023
And in the darkness bind them."

406
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:08,735
This is the one ring...

407
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:14,240
Forged by the dark lord Sauron
in the fires of mount doom.

408
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:18,369
Taken by isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

409
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,706
Bilbo found it.

410
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,083
- In gollum's cave.
- Yes.

411
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:28,922
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet
in bilbo's keeping...

412
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:32,467
Prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

413
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:37,597
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in mordor.

414
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,099
The ring has awoken.

415
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,144
It's heard its master's call.

416
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:47,190
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

417
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,989
No, Frodo.

418
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:59,285
The spirit of Sauron endured.

419
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,749
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

420
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,252
Sauron has returned.

421
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:10,296
His orcs have multiplied.

422
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,509
His fortress at barad-dur
is rebuilt in the land of mordor.

423
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:19,514
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

424
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:21,808
He is seeking it.

425
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:25,770
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

426
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,815
For the ring yearns above all else...

427
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:32,318
To return to the hand
of its master.

428
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,404
They are one...

429
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:37,657
The ring and the dark lord.

430
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,825
Frodo...

431
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:41,327
He must never find it.

432
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:42,537
All right.

433
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:47,208
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

434
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,044
No one knows it's here, do they?

435
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:56,926
Do they, Gandalf?

436
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:01,347
There is one other who knew
that bilbo had the ring.

437
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,685
I looked everywhere
for the creature gollum.

438
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:08,062
But the enemy found him first.

439
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:12,233
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

440
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:16,946
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

441
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,240
Shire!

442
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:21,075
Baggins!

443
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:26,164
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

444
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,001
Who goes there?

445
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:32,962
Take it, Gandalf!

446
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:34,464
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

447
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:37,050
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

448
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:40,511
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

449
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,223
I dare not take it.

450
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,018
Not even to keep it safe.

451
00:40:48,186 --> 00:40:50,188
Understand, Frodo...

452
00:40:50,855 --> 00:40:54,484
I would use this ring
from a desire to do good.

453
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:05,620
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

454
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:09,123
- But it cannot stay in the shire!
- No.

455
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,627
No, it can't.

456
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:19,342
What must I do?

457
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,597
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

458
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:28,017
Get out of the shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

459
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:29,435
Bree.

460
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,438
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

461
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:35,108
At the inn of the prancing pony.

462
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:39,028
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

463
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:41,155
I don't have any answers.

464
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:48,287
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

465
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:50,540
He'll know what to do.

466
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:53,960
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

467
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:56,754
That name is not safe
outside the shire.

468
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,675
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

469
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,470
I can cut across country
easily enough.

470
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:08,307
My dear Frodo.

471
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,686
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

472
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:14,814
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

473
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:17,358
And yet, after a hundred years...

474
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,652
They can still surprise you.

475
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,488
Get down.

476
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:38,296
Confound it all, samwise gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

477
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:42,967
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

478
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:45,595
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

479
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:48,681
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

480
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:49,849
Nothing important.

481
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:54,604
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a dark lord and the end of the world but...

482
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:59,484
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

483
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:04,155
Perhaps not.

484
00:43:05,364 --> 00:43:08,826
I've thought of a better use for you.

485
00:43:10,536 --> 00:43:13,539
Come along, samwise. Keep up.

486
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:17,418
Be careful, both of you.

487
00:43:17,502 --> 00:43:20,421
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

488
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:23,508
Birds, beasts.

489
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:27,053
Is it safe?

490
00:43:28,763 --> 00:43:30,223
Never put it on...

491
00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:33,768
For the agents of the dark lord
will be drawn to its power.

492
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:35,394
Always remember, Frodo...

493
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:39,065
The ring is trying to get back
to its master.

494
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,567
It wants to be found.

495
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:26,904
This is what?

496
00:44:27,196 --> 00:44:29,240
If I take one more step...

497
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,619
It'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

498
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:39,417
Come on, Sam.

499
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:49,635
Remember what bilbo used to say:

500
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:54,015
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
"Going out your door.

501
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:58,644
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

502
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:02,940
There's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

503
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:23,419
Wood-elves.

504
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:40,645
They're going to the harbor
beyond the white towers.

505
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:42,980
To the grey havens.

506
00:45:43,564 --> 00:45:45,650
They're leaving middle-earth.

507
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,985
Never to return.

508
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:52,990
I don't know why...

509
00:45:53,658 --> 00:45:56,077
It makes me sad.

510
00:45:58,162 --> 00:46:02,792
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

511
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,253
Just shut your eyes...

512
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:08,214
And imagine you're back
in your own bed...

513
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:12,301
With a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

514
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:24,355
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

515
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:27,358
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

516
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:32,029
Me neither, Sam.

517
00:47:00,558 --> 00:47:03,644
Male voice: Smoke rises
from the mountain of doom.

518
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:05,521
The hour grows late.

519
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:09,275
And Gandalf the grey
rides to lsengard...

520
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:11,944
Seeking my counsel.

521
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:16,115
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

522
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:17,533
My old friend.

523
00:47:17,783 --> 00:47:19,410
Saruman.

524
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:27,251
You are sure of this?
Beyond any doubt.

525
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:30,338
So the ring of power has been found.

526
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:33,758
All these long years,
it was in the shire.

527
00:47:33,841 --> 00:47:37,053
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

528
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:42,183
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

529
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:47,104
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

530
00:47:47,188 --> 00:47:48,689
Time?

531
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:52,234
What time do you think we have?

532
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:56,614
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

533
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,949
He cannot yet take physical form...

534
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,911
But his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

535
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:07,625
Concealed within his fortress,
the lord of mordor sees all.

536
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:14,131
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

537
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:18,803
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

538
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,975
A great eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

539
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:27,812
The eye of Sauron.

540
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:30,606
He is gathering all evil to him.

541
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:33,275
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

542
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,611
For an assault upon middle-earth.

543
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:38,322
You know this?

544
00:48:38,823 --> 00:48:40,324
How?

545
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,618
I have seen it.

546
00:48:43,035 --> 00:48:46,247
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
saruman.

547
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:48,457
Why?

548
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:51,627
Why should we fear to use it?

549
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:58,217
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

550
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,595
We do not know who else
may be watching.

551
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:06,976
The hour is later than you think.

552
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:09,437
Sauron's forces are already moving.

553
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:14,442
The nine have left minas morgul.

554
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:15,901
The nine?

555
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:19,155
They crossed the river isen
on midsummer's Eve...

556
00:49:19,238 --> 00:49:22,032
Disguised as riders in black.

557
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:26,120
- They've reached the shire?
- They will find the ring.

558
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:29,957
And kill the one who carries it.

559
00:49:44,555 --> 00:49:48,976
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

560
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:52,521
There are none who can.

561
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:57,776
Against the power of mordor...

562
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,571
There can be no victory.

563
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:05,701
We mustjoin with him, Gandalf.

564
00:50:06,994 --> 00:50:09,330
We mustjoin with Sauron.

565
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:14,668
It would be wise, my friend.

566
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:16,629
Tell me...

567
00:50:16,712 --> 00:50:17,838
Friend...

568
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:23,385
When did saruman the wise
abandon reason for madness?

569
00:51:02,883 --> 00:51:04,593
I gave you the chance...

570
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:08,430
Of aiding me willingly...

571
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:12,726
But you have elected
the way of pain!

572
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,501
Mr. Frodo?

573
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,920
Frodo? Frodo!

574
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:44,633
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

575
00:51:44,717 --> 00:51:47,761
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

576
00:51:48,596 --> 00:51:52,474
"Don't you lose him, samwise gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

577
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:56,353
Sam, we're still in the shire.
What could possibly happen?

578
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:00,357
Frodo.

579
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:02,901
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

580
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:04,445
Get off him.

581
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:06,488
Come on, Frodo.

582
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:08,490
What's the meaning of this?

583
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:10,701
You've been into farmer maggot's crop!

584
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:15,331
You get back here!

585
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:17,708
Get out of my field!

586
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,753
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

587
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:23,881
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

588
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:25,174
And some cabbages.

589
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:28,260
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

590
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:32,556
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Merry: Yes, pippin. My point is...

591
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,933
He's clearly overreacting.

592
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:52,576
Oh, that was close.

593
00:52:53,661 --> 00:52:56,789
I think I've broken something.

594
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,209
Trust a brandybuck and a took!

595
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:04,046
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

596
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:06,423
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

597
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:16,684
That's mine.

598
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:21,063
That's nice, merry.

599
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:23,691
Here's a nice one, Sam.

600
00:53:23,774 --> 00:53:26,360
I think we should get off the road.

601
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:36,995
Get off the road!

602
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,622
Quick!

603
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:52,803
Be quiet!

604
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,288
What was that?

605
00:55:33,987 --> 00:55:35,489
Anything?

606
00:55:36,156 --> 00:55:37,658
Nothing.

607
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,661
What is going on?

608
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:44,998
That black rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

609
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:47,835
Frodo?

610
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:49,586
Get down!

611
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,772
I have to leave the shire.

612
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:12,150
Sam and I must get to Bree.

613
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:13,694
Right.

614
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,364
Bucklebury ferry. Follow me.

615
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:26,999
Run!

616
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:30,210
This way! Follow me!

617
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:34,798
Run!

618
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:49,813
Get the rope, Sam!

619
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:56,153
Run, Frodo!

620
00:56:56,486 --> 00:56:57,654
Go! Hurry!

621
00:56:57,738 --> 00:57:00,407
Frodo, come on!

622
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:03,327
Come on! Faster!
Jump!

623
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,512
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The brandywine bridge. 20 miles.

624
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,612
Come on.

625
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,210
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the prancing pony.

626
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:03,679
What's more, out of the shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

627
00:58:04,096 --> 00:58:07,224
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

628
00:58:08,225 --> 00:58:10,852
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

629
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:13,563
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

630
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:16,566
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

631
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,860
Can't be too careful.

632
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:42,092
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

633
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:07,868
Excuse me.

634
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:11,747
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

635
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:18,045
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

636
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:22,799
Always proud to cater
to the little folk, mister...?

637
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:26,011
Underhill. My name's underhill.

638
00:59:27,304 --> 00:59:29,848
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the grey.

639
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:33,143
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

640
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:37,898
Oh, yes...

641
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:40,150
I remember. Elderly chap.

642
00:59:40,484 --> 00:59:43,403
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

643
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,655
Not seen him for six months.

644
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:53,705
What do we do now?

645
01:00:02,297 --> 01:00:04,216
He'll be here. He'll come.

646
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,054
Get out of my way!

647
01:00:11,431 --> 01:00:13,100
What's that?

648
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,894
This, my friend, is a pint.

649
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:17,687
It comes in pints?

650
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:21,733
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

651
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:31,910
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

652
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,957
Excuse me.

653
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:47,342
He's one of them rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the wilds.

654
01:00:47,592 --> 01:00:52,097
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as strider.

655
01:00:54,474 --> 01:00:55,725
Strider.

656
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:11,950
Voice of the ring: Baggins.

657
01:01:14,786 --> 01:01:16,955
Baggins.

658
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:27,465
Baggins. Baggins.

659
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:31,595
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

660
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:35,307
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

661
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:38,518
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

662
01:01:38,602 --> 01:01:40,937
And my third cousin, twice removed...

663
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:47,194
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

664
01:02:16,723 --> 01:02:19,184
Sau Ron: You cannot hide.

665
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:25,315
I see you.

666
01:02:26,983 --> 01:02:29,736
There is no life...

667
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:32,113
In the void.

668
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:33,740
Only...

669
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:47,045
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

670
01:02:51,716 --> 01:02:52,842
What do you want?

671
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:55,326
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

672
01:02:55,387 --> 01:02:58,390
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

673
01:02:58,682 --> 01:03:01,268
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

674
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:05,105
But to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

675
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:08,233
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

676
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:14,614
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

677
01:03:18,618 --> 01:03:21,162
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, longshanks.

678
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:27,002
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

679
01:03:27,085 --> 01:03:30,088
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

680
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:31,214
They're coming.

681
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:56,424
What are they?

682
01:04:58,593 --> 01:05:00,720
They were once men.

683
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:03,515
Great kings of men.

684
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:06,810
Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

685
01:05:07,394 --> 01:05:10,480
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

686
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:14,109
One by one, falling into darkness.

687
01:05:14,192 --> 01:05:16,736
Now they are slaves to his will.

688
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:20,865
They are the nazgul.

689
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:23,743
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

690
01:05:24,494 --> 01:05:25,995
At all times they feel...

691
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,123
The presence of the ring...

692
01:05:28,206 --> 01:05:32,794
Drawn to the power of the one.
They will never stop hunting you.

693
01:05:42,762 --> 01:05:45,682
- Frodo: Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

694
01:05:53,857 --> 01:05:58,027
How do we know this strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

695
01:05:58,111 --> 01:06:00,989
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

696
01:06:01,364 --> 01:06:05,285
- And feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

697
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:08,746
We have no choice but to trust him.

698
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:12,333
- But where is he leading us?
- Strider: To rivendell, master gamgee.

699
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:18,006
- To the house of elrond.
- Sam: Did you hear that? Rivendell.

700
01:06:18,548 --> 01:06:21,342
We're going to see the elves.

701
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:47,285
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

702
01:06:47,368 --> 01:06:50,121
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

703
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:52,499
What about second breakfast?

704
01:06:55,919 --> 01:06:59,130
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, pip.

705
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:04,594
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

706
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:08,890
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

707
01:07:14,354 --> 01:07:15,939
Pippin!

708
01:07:32,455 --> 01:07:35,959
What do they eat
when they can't get hobbit?

709
01:08:14,622 --> 01:08:16,833
Who is she?

710
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,128
This woman you sing of.

711
01:08:23,506 --> 01:08:26,009
'Tis the lady of li'ithien.

712
01:08:26,092 --> 01:08:31,306
The elf-maiden who gave her love
to beren, a mortal.

713
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:35,268
What happened to her?

714
01:08:37,478 --> 01:08:39,981
She died.

715
01:08:44,027 --> 01:08:46,362
Get some sleep, Frodo.

716
01:08:56,623 --> 01:09:00,752
Saru man: The power of isengard
is at your command...

717
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:05,340
Sauron, lord of the earth.

718
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:14,474
Sau Ron:
Build me an army worthy of mordor.

719
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:24,651
What orders from mordor, my lord?
What does the eye command?

720
01:09:25,068 --> 01:09:27,028
We have work to do.

721
01:10:09,612 --> 01:10:14,242
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

722
01:10:14,617 --> 01:10:16,452
Rip them all down.

723
01:10:43,896 --> 01:10:46,774
This was the great watchtower
of amon scil.

724
01:10:48,484 --> 01:10:51,154
We shall rest here tonight.

725
01:11:02,874 --> 01:11:06,377
These are for you.
Keep them close.

726
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:09,005
I'm going to have a look around.

727
01:11:11,382 --> 01:11:13,301
Stay here.

728
01:11:15,845 --> 01:11:18,014
My tomato's burst.

729
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:20,224
Could I have some bacon?

730
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,310
Want a tomato, Sam?

731
01:11:22,685 --> 01:11:26,397
- What are you doing?
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

732
01:11:26,481 --> 01:11:29,358
We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
Put it out, you fools!

733
01:11:29,442 --> 01:11:33,488
Put it out!
That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

734
01:12:37,093 --> 01:12:38,553
Back, you devils!

735
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,185
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

736
01:14:46,222 --> 01:14:47,223
Strider!

737
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:55,523
- Help him, strider.
- He's been stabbed by a morgul blade.

738
01:14:57,024 --> 01:15:01,904
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

739
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:07,618
Hurry!

740
01:15:07,702 --> 01:15:11,789
We're six days from rivendell!
He'll never make it!

741
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:13,749
Hold on, Frodo.

742
01:17:54,285 --> 01:17:57,371
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

743
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:02,376
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

744
01:18:05,337 --> 01:18:07,173
Is he going to die?

745
01:18:07,256 --> 01:18:12,178
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

746
01:18:17,349 --> 01:18:21,228
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the athelas plant?

747
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:22,897
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

748
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,190
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

749
01:18:24,273 --> 01:18:27,443
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

750
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:45,961
What's this?
A ranger caught off his guard?

751
01:19:10,861 --> 01:19:11,904
Frodo.

752
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:30,673
Who is she?

753
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,092
Frodo.

754
01:19:33,342 --> 01:19:36,845
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

755
01:19:39,098 --> 01:19:41,350
He's not going to last.

756
01:19:41,433 --> 01:19:44,144
We must get him to my father.

757
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,815
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

758
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:54,029
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

759
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,205
What are they saying?

760
01:20:09,211 --> 01:20:10,879
I do not fear them.

761
01:20:20,723 --> 01:20:22,182
Arwen...

762
01:20:30,566 --> 01:20:34,945
What are you doing?
Those wraiths are still out there!

763
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,271
Give up the halfling, she-elf.

764
01:22:33,188 --> 01:22:35,774
If you want him, come and claim him.

765
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:37,794
Frodo, no.

766
01:23:37,878 --> 01:23:40,297
Frodo, don't give in.

767
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,424
Not now.

768
01:23:53,352 --> 01:23:55,854
What grace is given me...

769
01:23:56,522 --> 01:23:58,357
Let it pass to him.

770
01:23:58,607 --> 01:24:00,734
Let him be spared.

771
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,403
Save him.

772
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:20,963
- Where am I?
- Gandalf: You are in the house of elrond.

773
01:24:21,421 --> 01:24:27,928
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

774
01:24:29,888 --> 01:24:33,684
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

775
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,397
And you're lucky to be here too.

776
01:24:39,064 --> 01:24:43,151
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

777
01:24:43,235 --> 01:24:47,406
But you have some strength in you,
my dear hobbit.

778
01:24:54,997 --> 01:24:57,499
What happened, Gandalf?

779
01:24:58,458 --> 01:25:03,839
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

780
01:25:08,594 --> 01:25:10,345
I was delayed.

781
01:25:11,221 --> 01:25:15,434
A friendship with saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

782
01:25:19,521 --> 01:25:24,192
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

783
01:25:24,484 --> 01:25:27,237
Embrace the power of the ring...

784
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:30,324
Or embrace your own destruction!

785
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:36,496
There is only one lord of the ring.

786
01:25:36,747 --> 01:25:40,751
Only one who can bend it to his will.

787
01:25:41,543 --> 01:25:45,505
And he does not share power.

788
01:25:59,853 --> 01:26:03,231
So you have chosen death.

789
01:26:13,283 --> 01:26:17,079
Gandalf? What is it?

790
01:26:18,038 --> 01:26:19,831
Nothing, Frodo.

791
01:26:20,499 --> 01:26:22,417
Frodo!

792
01:26:23,752 --> 01:26:26,254
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

793
01:26:26,338 --> 01:26:29,091
Sam has hardly left your side.

794
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:31,541
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

795
01:26:31,885 --> 01:26:37,015
By the skills of lord elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

796
01:26:38,517 --> 01:26:42,104
Welcome to rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

797
01:27:30,152 --> 01:27:33,530
- Frodo: Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

798
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,122
"There and back again:

799
01:27:42,372 --> 01:27:45,125
A hobbit's tale, by bilbo Baggins."

800
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:51,757
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

801
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:55,886
Wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

802
01:27:56,344 --> 01:27:58,638
Visit lake-town...

803
01:27:58,889 --> 01:28:02,267
See the lonely mountain again.

804
01:28:02,684 --> 01:28:07,606
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

805
01:28:19,701 --> 01:28:21,495
I miss the shire.

806
01:28:21,912 --> 01:28:27,042
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

807
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,962
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

808
01:28:33,924 --> 01:28:37,511
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

809
01:28:42,724 --> 01:28:45,936
I'm not like you, bilbo.

810
01:28:47,062 --> 01:28:49,397
My dear boy.

811
01:28:53,485 --> 01:28:57,447
- Sam: Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

812
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,116
No harm in being prepared.

813
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,869
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

814
01:29:02,953 --> 01:29:05,956
- More than anything.
- I did.

815
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:07,999
It's just...

816
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,461
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

817
01:29:11,545 --> 01:29:15,340
We got the ring this far,
to rivendell. And I thought...

818
01:29:15,423 --> 01:29:18,844
Seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

819
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,852
You are right, Sam.

820
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,773
We did what we set out to do.

821
01:29:32,357 --> 01:29:34,943
The ring will be safe in rivendell.

822
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,366
I am ready to go home.

823
01:29:42,117 --> 01:29:44,244
His strength returns.

824
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:50,083
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

825
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:53,253
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the ring...

826
01:29:53,336 --> 01:29:57,173
The hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

827
01:29:57,257 --> 01:30:00,635
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

828
01:30:00,886 --> 01:30:06,391
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

829
01:30:06,474 --> 01:30:11,146
Sauron's forces are massing in the east.
His eye is fixed on rivendell.

830
01:30:11,396 --> 01:30:14,190
And saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

831
01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:17,569
Our list of allies grows thin.

832
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,197
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

833
01:30:21,281 --> 01:30:25,035
By foul craft, saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

834
01:30:25,118 --> 01:30:27,621
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of lsengard.

835
01:30:27,913 --> 01:30:32,542
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

836
01:30:32,626 --> 01:30:35,086
Saruman is coming for the ring.

837
01:30:35,545 --> 01:30:39,674
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

838
01:30:39,758 --> 01:30:44,179
We do not have the strength
to fight both mordor and lsengard!

839
01:30:50,435 --> 01:30:53,021
The ring cannot stay here.

840
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,710
This peril belongs
to all middle-earth.

841
01:31:15,961 --> 01:31:18,672
They must decide now how to end it.

842
01:31:19,714 --> 01:31:23,301
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

843
01:31:23,969 --> 01:31:27,597
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

844
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:32,852
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

845
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:37,315
It is in men
that we must place our hope.

846
01:31:37,649 --> 01:31:39,359
Men?

847
01:31:40,235 --> 01:31:43,530
Men are weak.
The race of men is failing.

848
01:31:43,613 --> 01:31:48,118
The blood of numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

849
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:51,997
It is because of men
the ring survives.

850
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,748
I was there, Gandalf.

851
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:57,252
I was there 3000 years ago...

852
01:32:04,092 --> 01:32:06,553
When isildur took the ring.

853
01:32:06,636 --> 01:32:10,598
I was there the day
the strength of men failed.

854
01:32:13,143 --> 01:32:15,687
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

855
01:32:17,272 --> 01:32:20,900
I led isildur into the heart
of mount doom...

856
01:32:21,151 --> 01:32:24,738
Where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

857
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:27,449
Cast it into the fire!

858
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:36,416
- Destroy it!
- No.

859
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:39,919
Isildur!

860
01:32:40,378 --> 01:32:45,133
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

861
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:53,475
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

862
01:32:54,392 --> 01:32:58,104
There's no strength left
in the world of men.

863
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:03,151
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

864
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:06,654
One who could reclaim
the throne of gondor.

865
01:33:08,323 --> 01:33:12,202
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

866
01:33:12,285 --> 01:33:14,454
He has chosen exile.

867
01:33:45,693 --> 01:33:47,737
You are no elf.

868
01:33:47,821 --> 01:33:49,948
Men of the south are welcome here.

869
01:33:50,532 --> 01:33:54,035
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the grey.

870
01:33:55,537 --> 01:33:58,373
Then we are here on common purpose...

871
01:33:58,748 --> 01:34:00,208
Friend.

872
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:18,309
The shards of narsil.

873
01:34:21,771 --> 01:34:26,234
The blade that cut the ring
from Sauron's hand.

874
01:34:29,154 --> 01:34:31,406
It's still sharp.

875
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:43,376
But no more than a broken heirloom.

876
01:35:10,195 --> 01:35:13,239
Why do you fear the past?

877
01:35:14,115 --> 01:35:19,454
You are isildur's heir,
not isildur himself.

878
01:35:19,704 --> 01:35:23,124
You are not bound to his fate.

879
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:27,629
The same blood flows in my veins.

880
01:35:30,632 --> 01:35:33,218
The same weakness.

881
01:35:35,929 --> 01:35:38,806
Your time will come.

882
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:43,311
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

883
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:36,531
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

884
01:36:38,533 --> 01:36:43,538
Forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

885
01:36:44,664 --> 01:36:46,582
And to that I hold.

886
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:50,336
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

887
01:36:50,586 --> 01:36:54,465
Than face all the ages
of this world alone.

888
01:37:03,224 --> 01:37:06,686
I choose a mortal life.

889
01:37:08,021 --> 01:37:12,275
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

890
01:37:15,528 --> 01:37:18,031
Like my heart.

891
01:37:33,796 --> 01:37:37,592
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

892
01:37:37,675 --> 01:37:41,637
You've been summoned here
to answer the threat of mordor.

893
01:37:42,263 --> 01:37:47,143
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

894
01:37:47,393 --> 01:37:50,980
You will unite, or you will fall.

895
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:55,401
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

896
01:37:57,236 --> 01:38:00,740
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

897
01:38:14,796 --> 01:38:16,547
So it is true.

898
01:38:33,981 --> 01:38:36,109
In a dream...

899
01:38:37,693 --> 01:38:40,822
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

900
01:38:41,114 --> 01:38:42,824
But in the west
a pale light lingered.

901
01:38:43,616 --> 01:38:45,368
A voice was crying:

902
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,579
"Your doom is near at hand.

903
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:52,333
Isildur's bane is found."

904
01:38:56,337 --> 01:38:58,172
Isildur's bane.

905
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,216
Boromir!

906
01:39:23,322 --> 01:39:27,201
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in imladris.

907
01:39:27,285 --> 01:39:31,080
I do not ask your pardon,
master elrond...

908
01:39:31,164 --> 01:39:33,332
For the black speech of mordor...

909
01:39:33,624 --> 01:39:35,042
May yet be heard...

910
01:39:35,126 --> 01:39:38,212
In every corner of the west!

911
01:39:38,296 --> 01:39:41,007
The ring is altogether evil.

912
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,842
It is a gift.

913
01:39:43,426 --> 01:39:45,511
A gift to the foes of mordor.

914
01:39:46,137 --> 01:39:48,306
Why not use this ring?

915
01:39:48,389 --> 01:39:51,267
Long has my father,
the steward of gondor...

916
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:55,730
Kept the forces of mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

917
01:39:56,022 --> 01:39:58,232
Are your lands kept safe.

918
01:40:00,026 --> 01:40:04,363
Give gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

919
01:40:04,655 --> 01:40:08,409
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

920
01:40:09,035 --> 01:40:13,122
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

921
01:40:13,206 --> 01:40:16,792
And what would a ranger know
of this matter?

922
01:40:17,084 --> 01:40:19,086
This is no mere ranger.

923
01:40:20,087 --> 01:40:23,758
He is aragorn, son of arathorn.

924
01:40:24,258 --> 01:40:27,178
You owe him your allegiance.

925
01:40:31,265 --> 01:40:33,184
Aragorn.

926
01:40:34,936 --> 01:40:37,772
This is isildur's heir?

927
01:40:40,107 --> 01:40:42,818
And heir to the throne of gondor.

928
01:40:49,784 --> 01:40:52,620
Gondor has no king.

929
01:40:54,455 --> 01:40:56,123
Gondor needs no king.

930
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:06,467
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

931
01:41:07,468 --> 01:41:10,972
You have only one choice.

932
01:41:11,222 --> 01:41:13,599
The ring must be destroyed.

933
01:41:18,813 --> 01:41:21,357
What are we waiting for?

934
01:41:33,494 --> 01:41:36,497
The ring cannot be destroyed, gimli,
son of gléin...

935
01:41:36,747 --> 01:41:41,002
By any craft that we here possess.

936
01:41:41,502 --> 01:41:45,715
The ring was made in the fires
of mount doom.

937
01:41:45,798 --> 01:41:49,677
Only there can it be unmade.

938
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,389
It must be taken deep into mordor...

939
01:41:53,472 --> 01:41:57,351
And cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

940
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:02,523
One of you...

941
01:42:03,024 --> 01:42:05,192
Must do this.

942
01:42:08,112 --> 01:42:11,824
One does not simply walk into mordor.

943
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:16,370
Its black gates are guarded
by more than just orcs.

944
01:42:17,204 --> 01:42:21,417
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

945
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:25,755
The great eye is ever-watchful.

946
01:42:26,547 --> 01:42:28,633
It is a barren wasteland...

947
01:42:28,716 --> 01:42:32,428
Riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

948
01:42:32,511 --> 01:42:36,390
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

949
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:40,895
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

950
01:42:41,145 --> 01:42:45,650
Have you heard nothing lord elrond
has said? The ring must be destroyed.

951
01:42:45,733 --> 01:42:48,444
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

952
01:42:48,527 --> 01:42:53,282
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

953
01:42:53,366 --> 01:42:58,788
I will be dead before I see the ring
in the hands of an elf!

954
01:43:00,706 --> 01:43:03,250
Never trust an elf!

955
01:43:04,418 --> 01:43:10,257
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

956
01:43:10,591 --> 01:43:13,427
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

957
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:34,448
I will take it.

958
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:38,953
I will take it.

959
01:43:44,792 --> 01:43:47,837
I will take the ring to mordor.

960
01:43:55,886 --> 01:43:57,138
Though...

961
01:44:00,224 --> 01:44:02,059
I do not know the way.

962
01:44:04,061 --> 01:44:08,441
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

963
01:44:08,524 --> 01:44:11,944
As long as it is yours to bear.

964
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:16,157
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

965
01:44:16,907 --> 01:44:18,242
I will.

966
01:44:21,454 --> 01:44:23,748
You have my sword.

967
01:44:25,583 --> 01:44:27,668
And you have my bow.

968
01:44:28,252 --> 01:44:30,755
And my ax.

969
01:44:37,762 --> 01:44:40,765
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

970
01:44:42,767 --> 01:44:46,437
If this is indeed
the will of the council...

971
01:44:46,896 --> 01:44:49,315
- Then gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

972
01:44:51,942 --> 01:44:56,781
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

973
01:44:56,864 --> 01:45:01,786
Even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

974
01:45:02,286 --> 01:45:04,246
We're coming too!

975
01:45:06,373 --> 01:45:09,126
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

976
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:12,713
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

977
01:45:13,047 --> 01:45:14,423
Mission.

978
01:45:14,507 --> 01:45:16,050
Quest.

979
01:45:16,509 --> 01:45:17,551
Thing.

980
01:45:19,386 --> 01:45:22,056
Well, that rules you out, pip.

981
01:45:23,641 --> 01:45:25,559
Nine companions.

982
01:45:27,394 --> 01:45:29,230
So be it.

983
01:45:29,563 --> 01:45:32,566
You shall be
the fellowship of the ring.

984
01:45:33,234 --> 01:45:35,152
Great!

985
01:45:35,236 --> 01:45:37,571
Where are we going?

986
01:46:30,638 --> 01:46:34,141
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

987
01:46:34,642 --> 01:46:36,310
That you'd never escape your fate.

988
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:40,481
The skill of the elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

989
01:46:40,898 --> 01:46:44,818
But only you have the power
to wield it.

990
01:46:45,819 --> 01:46:48,322
I do not want that power.

991
01:46:48,489 --> 01:46:51,158
I have never wanted it.

992
01:46:52,493 --> 01:46:55,120
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

993
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,835
My old sword! Sting.

994
01:47:02,044 --> 01:47:03,170
Here, take it. Take it.

995
01:47:08,676 --> 01:47:12,638
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the elves, you know.

996
01:47:13,347 --> 01:47:17,434
The blade glows blue
when orcs are close.

997
01:47:17,643 --> 01:47:22,189
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

998
01:47:22,398 --> 01:47:24,858
Here's a pretty thing.

999
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:31,740
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1000
01:47:31,949 --> 01:47:35,202
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1001
01:47:38,747 --> 01:47:40,207
Oh!

1002
01:47:43,252 --> 01:47:45,295
My old ring.

1003
01:47:46,547 --> 01:47:50,467
I should very much like...

1004
01:47:50,718 --> 01:47:54,722
To hold it again, one last time.

1005
01:48:12,072 --> 01:48:15,743
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1006
01:48:16,076 --> 01:48:20,205
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1007
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:27,755
I'm sorry for everything.

1008
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:46,982
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of mount doom.

1009
01:48:48,317 --> 01:48:50,944
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1010
01:48:51,153 --> 01:48:54,281
Nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1011
01:48:57,743 --> 01:49:00,287
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1012
01:49:00,746 --> 01:49:04,666
May the blessings of elves and men...

1013
01:49:05,209 --> 01:49:07,795
And all free folk go with you.

1014
01:49:10,881 --> 01:49:14,968
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1015
01:49:33,403 --> 01:49:35,906
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1016
01:49:36,448 --> 01:49:38,283
Left.

1017
01:50:57,779 --> 01:51:02,201
We must hold to this course,
west of the misty mountains, for 40 days.

1018
01:51:02,409 --> 01:51:06,163
If our luck holds, the gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1019
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:09,917
From there, our road
turns east to mordor.

1020
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:13,921
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1021
01:51:15,756 --> 01:51:16,798
Move your feet.

1022
01:51:17,007 --> 01:51:18,526
- Merry: You look good, pippin.
- Thanks.

1023
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,927
Faster!

1024
01:51:21,303 --> 01:51:25,098
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1025
01:51:25,307 --> 01:51:28,060
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1026
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,605
Gandalf, we could pass through
the mines of Moria.

1027
01:51:32,272 --> 01:51:36,109
My cousin balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1028
01:51:36,443 --> 01:51:41,823
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1029
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:52,125
Sorry!

1030
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,461
Get him!

1031
01:51:55,796 --> 01:51:58,257
For the shire!
Hold him. Hold him down, merry!

1032
01:51:58,799 --> 01:52:01,134
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1033
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:06,650
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1034
01:52:06,974 --> 01:52:09,643
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1035
01:52:09,893 --> 01:52:12,604
It's moving fast.

1036
01:52:12,813 --> 01:52:14,982
Against the wind.

1037
01:52:15,774 --> 01:52:17,901
- Crebain from dunland!
- Hide!

1038
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:20,821
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1039
01:52:54,229 --> 01:52:55,981
Spies of saruman.

1040
01:52:56,732 --> 01:53:00,027
The passage south is being watched.

1041
01:53:01,194 --> 01:53:04,531
We must take the pass of caradhras.

1042
01:53:17,169 --> 01:53:18,879
Frodo!

1043
01:53:37,856 --> 01:53:40,108
Boromir.

1044
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:44,571
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1045
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:47,908
Over so small a thing.

1046
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:53,080
Such a little thing.

1047
01:53:53,288 --> 01:53:54,748
Boromir!

1048
01:53:55,374 --> 01:53:58,085
Give the ring to Frodo.

1049
01:54:07,886 --> 01:54:09,930
As you wish.

1050
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:12,641
I care not.

1051
01:54:48,051 --> 01:54:52,764
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over caradhras.

1052
01:54:52,973 --> 01:54:57,561
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1053
01:54:58,854 --> 01:55:01,815
If the mountain defeats you...

1054
01:55:02,065 --> 01:55:06,486
Will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1055
01:55:18,832 --> 01:55:21,710
There is a fell voice on the air.

1056
01:55:22,836 --> 01:55:24,337
It's saruman!

1057
01:55:33,221 --> 01:55:37,893
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1058
01:56:46,419 --> 01:56:48,255
We must get off the mountain!

1059
01:56:48,755 --> 01:56:53,093
Make for the gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1060
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:56,596
The gap of Rohan takes us
too close to lsengard!

1061
01:56:56,763 --> 01:57:00,517
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1062
01:57:00,767 --> 01:57:03,603
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1063
01:57:05,438 --> 01:57:09,276
Saru man: Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1064
01:57:09,943 --> 01:57:14,948
The dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1065
01:57:15,782 --> 01:57:20,662
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of khazad—dum:

1066
01:57:21,955 --> 01:57:25,458
Shadow and flame.

1067
01:57:28,795 --> 01:57:31,464
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1068
01:57:36,177 --> 01:57:38,305
We cannot stay here!

1069
01:57:38,471 --> 01:57:41,308
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1070
01:57:41,474 --> 01:57:43,184
Frodo?

1071
01:57:46,187 --> 01:57:49,065
We will go through the mines.

1072
01:57:49,816 --> 01:57:51,693
So be it.

1073
01:57:58,325 --> 01:58:02,287
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1074
01:58:05,832 --> 01:58:08,001
How is your shoulder?

1075
01:58:08,209 --> 01:58:11,504
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1076
01:58:13,006 --> 01:58:15,508
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1077
01:58:16,009 --> 01:58:18,928
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1078
01:58:19,346 --> 01:58:23,266
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the fellowship.

1079
01:58:23,433 --> 01:58:26,019
And, I fear, from within.

1080
01:58:28,688 --> 01:58:32,859
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1081
01:58:33,026 --> 01:58:35,862
Trust your own strengths.

1082
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:38,615
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1083
01:58:38,823 --> 01:58:40,867
For good or for evil.

1084
01:58:41,034 --> 01:58:43,370
Some are greater than I am.

1085
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:47,540
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1086
01:58:48,875 --> 01:58:50,251
The walls...

1087
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,046
Of Moria.

1088
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:01,763
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1089
01:59:01,971 --> 01:59:06,393
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1090
01:59:06,768 --> 01:59:09,270
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1091
01:59:17,278 --> 01:59:20,573
Well, let's see.

1092
01:59:22,784 --> 01:59:26,162
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1093
01:59:40,218 --> 01:59:44,305
It reads, "the doors of Durin,
lord of Moria.

1094
01:59:44,889 --> 01:59:49,519
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1095
01:59:49,769 --> 01:59:54,524
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1096
02:00:18,298 --> 02:00:19,424
Nothing's happening.

1097
02:00:26,431 --> 02:00:30,643
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of elves...

1098
02:00:30,977 --> 02:00:33,813
Men and orcs.

1099
02:00:34,063 --> 02:00:35,315
What are you going to do, then?

1100
02:00:35,482 --> 02:00:37,734
Knock your head against these doors,
peregrin took!

1101
02:00:37,984 --> 02:00:39,986
And if that does not shatter them...

1102
02:00:40,153 --> 02:00:42,864
And I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1103
02:00:43,031 --> 02:00:46,493
I will try to find the opening words.

1104
02:00:59,339 --> 02:01:01,883
Mines are no place for a pony.

1105
02:01:02,091 --> 02:01:06,179
- Even one so brave as bill.
- Bye-bye, bill.

1106
02:01:07,347 --> 02:01:10,183
Go on, bill. Go on.

1107
02:01:10,683 --> 02:01:14,229
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1108
02:01:21,027 --> 02:01:23,613
Do not disturb the water.

1109
02:01:23,863 --> 02:01:25,698
Oh, it's useless.

1110
02:01:43,299 --> 02:01:46,427
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1111
02:01:46,803 --> 02:01:49,722
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1112
02:02:10,577 --> 02:02:15,415
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1113
02:02:15,915 --> 02:02:21,588
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1114
02:02:23,089 --> 02:02:26,175
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin balin.

1115
02:02:26,551 --> 02:02:28,928
And they call it a mine.

1116
02:02:29,137 --> 02:02:31,097
A mine!

1117
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:35,476
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1118
02:02:48,781 --> 02:02:50,283
Goblins.

1119
02:02:54,203 --> 02:02:58,499
We make for the gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1120
02:02:59,584 --> 02:03:02,128
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1121
02:03:04,964 --> 02:03:07,300
Frodo! Help!

1122
02:03:07,508 --> 02:03:09,135
Strider!

1123
02:03:09,302 --> 02:03:12,138
Help! Get off him!

1124
02:03:12,305 --> 02:03:13,306
Aragorn!

1125
02:03:25,985 --> 02:03:27,528
Strider!

1126
02:03:51,135 --> 02:03:52,178
Into the mines!

1127
02:03:52,345 --> 02:03:55,556
- Legolas!
- Aragorn: Into the cave!

1128
02:04:18,538 --> 02:04:22,083
We now have but one choice.

1129
02:04:22,291 --> 02:04:27,213
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1130
02:04:27,422 --> 02:04:29,382
Be on your guard.

1131
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:33,052
There are older
and fouler things than orcs...

1132
02:04:33,219 --> 02:04:36,764
In the deep places of the world.

1133
02:04:44,731 --> 02:04:48,693
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1134
02:04:48,901 --> 02:04:52,739
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1135
02:05:38,493 --> 02:05:42,205
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1136
02:05:42,371 --> 02:05:44,791
Orjewels...

1137
02:05:44,957 --> 02:05:48,002
But mithril.

1138
02:06:06,354 --> 02:06:11,275
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1139
02:06:11,484 --> 02:06:15,488
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1140
02:06:15,655 --> 02:06:17,532
I never told him...

1141
02:06:17,698 --> 02:06:22,662
But its worth was greater than
the value of the shire.

1142
02:06:35,007 --> 02:06:36,717
Pippin.

1143
02:06:57,405 --> 02:07:00,032
I have no memory of this place.

1144
02:07:02,118 --> 02:07:03,619
Are we lost? No.

1145
02:07:03,828 --> 02:07:06,330
I think we are.
Gandalf's thinking.

1146
02:07:06,539 --> 02:07:07,957
Merry? What?

1147
02:07:08,249 --> 02:07:10,209
I'm hungry.

1148
02:07:21,512 --> 02:07:25,975
- There's something down there.
- It's gollum.

1149
02:07:26,184 --> 02:07:30,313
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1150
02:07:30,521 --> 02:07:34,692
- He escaped the dungeons of barad-dur?
- Escaped...

1151
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:37,028
Or was set loose.

1152
02:07:37,528 --> 02:07:41,199
Now the ring has brought him here.

1153
02:07:43,826 --> 02:07:46,579
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1154
02:07:46,746 --> 02:07:52,501
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1155
02:07:52,668 --> 02:07:57,548
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1156
02:07:57,715 --> 02:08:03,679
Yes, sméagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1157
02:08:04,597 --> 02:08:07,391
Before it drove him mad.

1158
02:08:07,683 --> 02:08:10,561
It's a pity bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1159
02:08:10,728 --> 02:08:11,938
Pity?

1160
02:08:13,022 --> 02:08:15,900
It is pity that stayed bilbo's hand.

1161
02:08:16,817 --> 02:08:22,031
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1162
02:08:23,449 --> 02:08:25,952
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1163
02:08:28,371 --> 02:08:32,333
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1164
02:08:32,541 --> 02:08:35,461
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1165
02:08:36,045 --> 02:08:41,968
My heart tells me that gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1166
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:45,596
Before this is over.

1167
02:08:47,098 --> 02:08:50,977
The pity of bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1168
02:08:57,608 --> 02:09:00,987
I wish the ring
had never come to me.

1169
02:09:02,405 --> 02:09:04,448
I wish none of this had happened.

1170
02:09:04,615 --> 02:09:09,662
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1171
02:09:10,496 --> 02:09:16,002
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1172
02:09:17,503 --> 02:09:21,507
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1173
02:09:21,882 --> 02:09:24,302
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1174
02:09:24,802 --> 02:09:29,140
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1175
02:09:29,307 --> 02:09:32,518
And that is an encouraging thought.

1176
02:09:35,438 --> 02:09:36,605
Ah!

1177
02:09:37,398 --> 02:09:39,317
It's that way.

1178
02:09:39,525 --> 02:09:41,819
He's remembered. No.

1179
02:09:42,028 --> 02:09:45,823
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1180
02:09:46,032 --> 02:09:51,203
If in doubt, meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1181
02:10:06,052 --> 02:10:10,181
Let me risk a little more light.

1182
02:10:17,355 --> 02:10:22,568
The great realm
and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf.

1183
02:10:25,071 --> 02:10:28,491
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1184
02:10:53,391 --> 02:10:55,101
Gimli!

1185
02:11:06,737 --> 02:11:09,907
Oh, no.

1186
02:11:20,292 --> 02:11:22,294
"Here lies balin...

1187
02:11:22,753 --> 02:11:24,755
Son of fundin...

1188
02:11:25,089 --> 02:11:27,716
Lord of Moria."

1189
02:11:28,759 --> 02:11:30,428
He is dead, then.

1190
02:11:32,596 --> 02:11:33,806
It's as I feared.

1191
02:11:52,116 --> 02:11:55,035
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1192
02:11:55,244 --> 02:11:59,957
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1193
02:12:01,041 --> 02:12:03,627
We have barred the gates...

1194
02:12:04,295 --> 02:12:06,797
But cannot hold them for long.

1195
02:12:06,964 --> 02:12:09,800
The ground shakes.

1196
02:12:10,176 --> 02:12:11,802
Drums...

1197
02:12:12,178 --> 02:12:15,556
Drums in the deep.

1198
02:12:19,101 --> 02:12:21,145
We cannot get out.

1199
02:12:23,147 --> 02:12:26,984
A shadow moves in the dark.

1200
02:12:28,652 --> 02:12:31,197
We cannot get out.

1201
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,160
They are coming."

1202
02:13:19,203 --> 02:13:21,038
Fool of a took!

1203
02:13:21,372 --> 02:13:25,209
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1204
02:13:51,151 --> 02:13:52,778
Frodo!

1205
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:56,574
Orcs.

1206
02:14:03,622 --> 02:14:05,624
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1207
02:14:12,881 --> 02:14:14,675
They have a cave-troll.

1208
02:14:30,482 --> 02:14:31,650
Let them come!

1209
02:14:32,151 --> 02:14:35,696
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1210
02:16:54,585 --> 02:16:57,337
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1211
02:17:37,294 --> 02:17:39,129
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1212
02:19:29,281 --> 02:19:30,616
Oh, no.

1213
02:19:38,999 --> 02:19:40,876
He's alive.

1214
02:19:43,295 --> 02:19:46,298
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1215
02:19:46,632 --> 02:19:48,800
You should be dead.

1216
02:19:49,009 --> 02:19:51,511
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1217
02:19:51,762 --> 02:19:56,516
I think there's more to this hobbit
than meets the eye.

1218
02:20:06,234 --> 02:20:08,820
You are full of surprises,
master Baggins.

1219
02:20:14,826 --> 02:20:16,787
To the bridge of khazad-dum!

1220
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:33,345
This way!

1221
02:21:43,749 --> 02:21:46,752
What is this new devilry?

1222
02:22:02,851 --> 02:22:05,645
A balrog.

1223
02:22:05,937 --> 02:22:09,107
A demon of the ancient world.

1224
02:22:11,276 --> 02:22:13,737
This foe is beyond any of you.

1225
02:22:23,789 --> 02:22:25,290
Quickly!

1226
02:22:43,809 --> 02:22:45,435
Lead them on, aragorn.

1227
02:22:46,812 --> 02:22:49,314
The bridge is near.

1228
02:22:51,399 --> 02:22:55,487
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1229
02:23:44,661 --> 02:23:45,871
Merry! Pippin!

1230
02:24:01,261 --> 02:24:04,514
Nobody tosses a dwarf.

1231
02:24:22,199 --> 02:24:24,075
Steady.

1232
02:24:48,934 --> 02:24:50,101
Hang on!

1233
02:25:00,904 --> 02:25:02,614
Lean forward!

1234
02:25:05,617 --> 02:25:06,618
Steady.

1235
02:25:07,953 --> 02:25:09,120
Come on!

1236
02:25:28,098 --> 02:25:29,891
Over the bridge!

1237
02:25:30,141 --> 02:25:31,643
Fly!

1238
02:26:16,354 --> 02:26:18,356
You cannot pass!

1239
02:26:24,404 --> 02:26:29,284
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of anor.

1240
02:26:30,285 --> 02:26:34,039
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of udun!

1241
02:26:44,049 --> 02:26:46,051
Go back to the shadow.

1242
02:26:53,892 --> 02:26:58,313
You shall not pass!

1243
02:27:25,465 --> 02:27:29,344
- Boromir: No! No!
- Gandalf!

1244
02:27:37,018 --> 02:27:39,479
Fly, you fools!

1245
02:27:51,950 --> 02:27:54,119
Aragorn!

1246
02:28:51,342 --> 02:28:54,179
Legolas, get them up.

1247
02:28:58,308 --> 02:29:00,143
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1248
02:29:00,310 --> 02:29:03,938
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with orcs.

1249
02:29:04,147 --> 02:29:07,484
We must reach the woods of lothlorien.

1250
02:29:08,359 --> 02:29:11,696
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1251
02:29:13,198 --> 02:29:15,366
On your feet, Sam.

1252
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:17,202
Frodo?

1253
02:30:13,508 --> 02:30:16,052
Stay close, young hobbits!

1254
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:20,932
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1255
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:23,685
An elf-witch...

1256
02:30:24,227 --> 02:30:27,105
Of terrible power.

1257
02:30:27,647 --> 02:30:29,857
All who look upon her...

1258
02:30:30,066 --> 02:30:31,859
Fall under her spell.

1259
02:30:32,068 --> 02:30:33,361
Female voice: Frodo!

1260
02:30:35,613 --> 02:30:37,657
And are never seen again.

1261
02:30:37,865 --> 02:30:42,370
Female voice: Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1262
02:30:42,579 --> 02:30:46,291
You bring great evil here,
ring-bearer.

1263
02:30:46,457 --> 02:30:48,251
Mr. Frodo?

1264
02:30:53,548 --> 02:30:59,137
Well, here's one dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1265
02:30:59,304 --> 02:31:03,891
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1266
02:31:11,566 --> 02:31:16,154
The dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1267
02:31:34,297 --> 02:31:36,591
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the elves!

1268
02:31:36,758 --> 02:31:38,676
Speak words we can all understand!

1269
02:31:38,843 --> 02:31:43,431
We have not had dealings
with the dwarves since the dark days.

1270
02:31:43,681 --> 02:31:46,225
And you know what this dwarf
says to that?

1271
02:31:53,149 --> 02:31:55,109
That was not so courteous.

1272
02:32:01,658 --> 02:32:05,703
You bring great evil with you.

1273
02:32:07,455 --> 02:32:09,666
You can go no further.

1274
02:32:46,911 --> 02:32:49,580
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1275
02:32:50,707 --> 02:32:52,583
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1276
02:32:54,085 --> 02:32:57,422
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1277
02:32:58,297 --> 02:33:01,426
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1278
02:33:04,387 --> 02:33:06,431
You will follow me.

1279
02:33:18,109 --> 02:33:20,111
Caras galadhon.

1280
02:33:20,737 --> 02:33:23,698
The heart of elvendom on earth.

1281
02:33:23,865 --> 02:33:29,537
Realm of the lord celeborn
and of Galadriel, lady of light.

1282
02:34:48,533 --> 02:34:51,661
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1283
02:34:52,328 --> 02:34:57,500
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1284
02:34:59,210 --> 02:35:03,673
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from rivendell.

1285
02:35:03,923 --> 02:35:05,716
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1286
02:35:05,925 --> 02:35:09,053
For I much desire to speak with him.

1287
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:12,014
I can no longer see him from afar.

1288
02:35:12,890 --> 02:35:18,062
Gandalf the grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1289
02:35:18,312 --> 02:35:20,731
He has fallen into shadow.

1290
02:35:25,444 --> 02:35:29,949
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1291
02:35:31,576 --> 02:35:35,329
A balrog of morgoth.

1292
02:35:36,038 --> 02:35:39,417
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1293
02:35:41,544 --> 02:35:44,755
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1294
02:35:45,423 --> 02:35:48,718
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1295
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:57,768
Do not let the great emptiness
of khazad-dum fill your heart...

1296
02:35:58,060 --> 02:36:00,396
Gimli, son of gléin.

1297
02:36:01,397 --> 02:36:04,942
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1298
02:36:06,402 --> 02:36:09,071
And in all lands...

1299
02:36:09,238 --> 02:36:12,742
Love is now mingled with grief.

1300
02:36:25,379 --> 02:36:28,090
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1301
02:36:28,633 --> 02:36:31,636
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1302
02:36:34,597 --> 02:36:37,892
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1303
02:36:38,059 --> 02:36:41,145
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1304
02:36:41,896 --> 02:36:44,732
To the ruin of all.

1305
02:36:49,070 --> 02:36:54,909
Yet hope remains
while the company is true.

1306
02:36:56,452 --> 02:37:01,165
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1307
02:37:01,624 --> 02:37:05,294
For you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1308
02:37:07,546 --> 02:37:09,674
Tonight, you will sleep...

1309
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,260
Welcome, Frodo of the shire...

1310
02:37:14,845 --> 02:37:16,639
One who has seen the eye!

1311
02:37:31,278 --> 02:37:33,864
A lament for Gandalf.

1312
02:37:41,122 --> 02:37:42,665
What do they say about him?

1313
02:37:42,873 --> 02:37:45,543
I have not the heart to tell you.

1314
02:37:48,295 --> 02:37:50,548
For me, the grief is still too near.

1315
02:37:53,509 --> 02:37:56,345
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1316
02:37:56,512 --> 02:37:59,557
There should be a verse about them.

1317
02:38:03,102 --> 02:38:05,104
The finest rockets ever seen

1318
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:09,066
they burst in stars of blue and green

1319
02:38:09,984 --> 02:38:13,404
or after thunder, silver showers

1320
02:38:15,906 --> 02:38:18,701
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1321
02:38:18,868 --> 02:38:22,747
oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1322
02:38:33,591 --> 02:38:36,260
Take some rest.

1323
02:38:36,427 --> 02:38:39,138
These borders are well-protected.

1324
02:38:39,346 --> 02:38:41,891
I will find no rest here.

1325
02:38:44,727 --> 02:38:47,730
I heard her voice inside my head.

1326
02:38:47,938 --> 02:38:51,692
She spoke of my father
and the fall of gondor.

1327
02:38:51,901 --> 02:38:57,364
She said to me,
"even now there is hope left."

1328
02:38:58,741 --> 02:39:01,577
But I cannot see it.

1329
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:05,414
It is long since we had any hope.

1330
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:17,718
My father is a noble man.

1331
02:39:18,469 --> 02:39:20,721
But his rule is failing...

1332
02:39:21,055 --> 02:39:26,477
And our people lose faith.

1333
02:39:27,895 --> 02:39:31,440
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1334
02:39:31,607 --> 02:39:35,152
I would see the glory
of gondor restored.

1335
02:39:37,988 --> 02:39:40,991
Have you ever seen it, aragorn?

1336
02:39:41,617 --> 02:39:43,661
The white tower of ecthelion.

1337
02:39:43,828 --> 02:39:47,665
Glimmering like a spike
of Pearl and silver.

1338
02:39:48,332 --> 02:39:51,836
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1339
02:39:54,713 --> 02:39:56,674
Have you ever been called home...

1340
02:39:56,841 --> 02:40:00,803
By the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1341
02:40:01,428 --> 02:40:04,682
I have seen the white city...

1342
02:40:05,015 --> 02:40:06,517
Long ago.

1343
02:40:07,476 --> 02:40:12,439
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1344
02:40:13,357 --> 02:40:16,318
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1345
02:40:16,777 --> 02:40:20,114
"The lords of gondor have returned."

1346
02:41:27,306 --> 02:41:29,850
Will you look into the mirror?

1347
02:41:30,017 --> 02:41:31,560
What will I see?

1348
02:41:34,521 --> 02:41:36,857
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1349
02:41:37,775 --> 02:41:39,610
For the mirror...

1350
02:41:39,818 --> 02:41:42,363
Shows many things.

1351
02:41:45,366 --> 02:41:47,743
Things that were...

1352
02:41:47,952 --> 02:41:50,537
Things that are...

1353
02:41:51,288 --> 02:41:53,249
And some things...

1354
02:41:56,835 --> 02:42:00,130
That have not yet come to pass.

1355
02:43:22,713 --> 02:43:25,549
I know what it is you saw.

1356
02:43:27,968 --> 02:43:30,471
For it is also in my mind.

1357
02:43:32,222 --> 02:43:36,310
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1358
02:43:38,687 --> 02:43:43,567
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1359
02:43:44,193 --> 02:43:47,488
He will try to take the ring.

1360
02:43:47,696 --> 02:43:49,698
You know of whom I speak.

1361
02:43:50,699 --> 02:43:55,371
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1362
02:43:56,872 --> 02:43:59,333
If you ask it of me...

1363
02:43:59,708 --> 02:44:02,753
I will give you the one ring.

1364
02:44:03,837 --> 02:44:06,006
You offer it to me freely.

1365
02:44:10,594 --> 02:44:14,515
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1366
02:44:20,896 --> 02:44:24,191
In place of a dark lord,
you would have a queen...

1367
02:44:24,608 --> 02:44:28,445
Not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1368
02:44:29,071 --> 02:44:32,116
Treacherous as the sea!

1369
02:44:32,616 --> 02:44:37,538
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1370
02:44:37,996 --> 02:44:40,374
All shall love me...

1371
02:44:40,582 --> 02:44:43,419
And despair.

1372
02:44:57,516 --> 02:45:01,812
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1373
02:45:02,104 --> 02:45:04,565
And go into the west...

1374
02:45:04,773 --> 02:45:09,236
- And remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1375
02:45:12,823 --> 02:45:16,994
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1376
02:45:17,911 --> 02:45:19,413
Is to be alone.

1377
02:45:22,749 --> 02:45:25,502
This is nenya,
the ring of adamant.

1378
02:45:25,669 --> 02:45:27,296
And I am its keeper.

1379
02:45:30,507 --> 02:45:34,136
This task was appointed to you.

1380
02:45:35,179 --> 02:45:38,056
And if you do not find a way...

1381
02:45:39,266 --> 02:45:41,268
No one will.

1382
02:45:41,643 --> 02:45:44,813
Then I know what I must do.

1383
02:45:45,481 --> 02:45:46,690
It's just...

1384
02:45:49,943 --> 02:45:52,196
I'm afraid to do it.

1385
02:45:55,699 --> 02:46:00,829
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1386
02:46:06,168 --> 02:46:11,882
Do you know how the orcs
first came into being?

1387
02:46:12,674 --> 02:46:16,011
They were elves once.

1388
02:46:17,179 --> 02:46:20,516
Taken by the dark powers...

1389
02:46:20,724 --> 02:46:23,894
Tortured and mutilated.

1390
02:46:24,228 --> 02:46:29,525
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1391
02:46:29,816 --> 02:46:31,652
And now...

1392
02:46:33,111 --> 02:46:34,988
Perfected.

1393
02:46:35,697 --> 02:46:38,867
My fighting uruk-hai...

1394
02:46:40,827 --> 02:46:43,163
Whom do you serve?

1395
02:46:43,372 --> 02:46:45,874
Saruman!

1396
02:47:06,728 --> 02:47:10,190
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1397
02:47:10,399 --> 02:47:13,277
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1398
02:47:13,527 --> 02:47:16,446
You will taste man-flesh!

1399
02:47:21,535 --> 02:47:25,247
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1400
02:47:25,414 --> 02:47:29,585
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1401
02:47:51,898 --> 02:47:57,321
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1402
02:47:58,447 --> 02:48:02,284
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1403
02:48:09,458 --> 02:48:11,001
Lembas.

1404
02:48:11,251 --> 02:48:12,836
Elvish waybread.

1405
02:48:15,339 --> 02:48:18,342
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1406
02:48:24,848 --> 02:48:26,808
How many did you eat?

1407
02:48:26,975 --> 02:48:28,644
Foun

1408
02:48:34,441 --> 02:48:37,041
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1409
02:48:37,235 --> 02:48:41,365
Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the anduin.

1410
02:48:41,531 --> 02:48:44,034
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1411
02:48:44,242 --> 02:48:48,038
Strange creatures bearing the white hand
have been seen on our borders.

1412
02:48:48,246 --> 02:48:53,335
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1413
02:49:05,931 --> 02:49:07,408
By river you have the chance...

1414
02:49:07,432 --> 02:49:10,644
Of outrunning the enemy
to the falls of rauros.

1415
02:49:27,911 --> 02:49:32,749
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the galadhrim.

1416
02:49:32,999 --> 02:49:36,503
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1417
02:49:41,883 --> 02:49:44,344
These are the daggers of the noldorin.

1418
02:49:44,511 --> 02:49:48,515
They have already seen service in war.

1419
02:49:48,682 --> 02:49:50,934
Do not fear, young peregrin took.

1420
02:49:51,101 --> 02:49:54,438
You will find your courage.

1421
02:49:56,314 --> 02:49:58,275
And for you, samwise gamgee...

1422
02:49:58,442 --> 02:50:01,027
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1423
02:50:01,194 --> 02:50:03,321
Thank you, my lady.

1424
02:50:05,115 --> 02:50:08,452
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1425
02:50:14,916 --> 02:50:17,961
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the elves?

1426
02:50:18,128 --> 02:50:20,255
Nothing.

1427
02:50:20,881 --> 02:50:24,217
Except to look upon the lady
of the galadhrim one last time...

1428
02:50:24,843 --> 02:50:30,056
For she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1429
02:50:37,105 --> 02:50:38,648
Actually...

1430
02:50:38,857 --> 02:50:40,484
There was one thing.

1431
02:50:41,318 --> 02:50:43,987
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1432
02:50:44,154 --> 02:50:46,948
Stupid to ask.

1433
02:50:49,493 --> 02:50:51,620
I have nothing greater to give...

1434
02:50:51,787 --> 02:50:55,373
Than the gift you already bear.

1435
02:51:21,024 --> 02:51:24,110
That choice is yet before her.

1436
02:51:24,694 --> 02:51:27,614
You have your own choice to make,
aragorn.

1437
02:51:27,948 --> 02:51:33,787
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of elendil...

1438
02:51:33,954 --> 02:51:38,291
Or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1439
02:52:05,861 --> 02:52:09,072
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1440
02:52:09,239 --> 02:52:12,659
I give you the light of earendil...

1441
02:52:13,410 --> 02:52:15,745
Our most beloved star.

1442
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:29,259
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1443
02:52:29,509 --> 02:52:33,597
When all other lights go out.

1444
02:52:42,439 --> 02:52:45,609
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1445
02:52:46,234 --> 02:52:50,530
Having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1446
02:52:51,281 --> 02:52:54,618
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1447
02:52:54,868 --> 02:52:56,786
What was her gift?

1448
02:52:56,995 --> 02:53:01,917
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1449
02:53:02,709 --> 02:53:05,587
She gave me three.

1450
02:54:47,731 --> 02:54:51,192
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1451
02:54:54,904 --> 02:54:58,033
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1452
02:54:58,241 --> 02:55:01,411
But he's too clever a waterman.

1453
02:55:02,245 --> 02:55:05,582
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1454
02:55:05,749 --> 02:55:08,001
It will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1455
02:55:08,168 --> 02:55:10,253
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1456
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:13,506
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1457
02:55:13,673 --> 02:55:16,760
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1458
02:55:17,719 --> 02:55:20,722
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1459
02:55:20,889 --> 02:55:22,057
But you're not.

1460
02:55:22,348 --> 02:55:24,851
I'm here to help you.

1461
02:55:25,018 --> 02:55:26,728
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1462
02:55:32,692 --> 02:55:35,445
You can't help me, Sam.

1463
02:55:42,202 --> 02:55:44,287
Get some sleep.

1464
02:55:50,543 --> 02:55:52,754
Minas tirith is the safer road.

1465
02:55:53,296 --> 02:55:56,049
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1466
02:55:56,716 --> 02:55:58,968
Strike out for mordor from a place
of strength.

1467
02:55:59,302 --> 02:56:02,180
There is no strength in gondor
that can avail us.

1468
02:56:02,639 --> 02:56:04,641
You were quick enough to trust
the elves.

1469
02:56:06,476 --> 02:56:09,312
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1470
02:56:09,479 --> 02:56:12,482
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1471
02:56:12,690 --> 02:56:15,985
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1472
02:56:16,236 --> 02:56:18,446
But you will not see that.

1473
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:20,198
You are afraid!

1474
02:56:20,448 --> 02:56:22,992
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1475
02:56:23,284 --> 02:56:26,746
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1476
02:56:29,165 --> 02:56:33,503
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1477
02:56:45,348 --> 02:56:46,724
Frodo.

1478
02:56:48,601 --> 02:56:50,103
The argonath.

1479
02:56:53,523 --> 02:56:57,277
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1480
02:56:58,027 --> 02:56:59,946
My kin.

1481
02:58:18,942 --> 02:58:21,110
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1482
02:58:21,361 --> 02:58:23,947
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1483
02:58:24,113 --> 02:58:27,617
- We approach mordor from the north.
- Oh, yes?

1484
02:58:28,034 --> 02:58:31,871
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through emyn muil...

1485
02:58:32,038 --> 02:58:35,291
An impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1486
02:58:35,458 --> 02:58:38,586
And after that, it gets even better.

1487
02:58:38,962 --> 02:58:43,925
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1488
02:58:44,092 --> 02:58:45,468
That is our road.

1489
02:58:47,053 --> 02:58:50,265
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, master dwarf.

1490
02:58:50,473 --> 02:58:52,225
Recover my...

1491
02:58:55,228 --> 02:58:57,230
- We should leave now.
- No.

1492
02:58:57,397 --> 02:59:01,859
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1493
02:59:02,068 --> 02:59:05,488
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1494
02:59:05,738 --> 02:59:09,742
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1495
02:59:10,243 --> 02:59:14,414
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1496
02:59:16,416 --> 02:59:21,379
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1497
02:59:21,879 --> 02:59:23,589
Where's Frodo?

1498
02:59:49,198 --> 02:59:51,117
None of us should wander alone.

1499
02:59:52,535 --> 02:59:54,620
You, least of all.

1500
02:59:54,829 --> 02:59:57,290
So much depends on you.

1501
02:59:58,333 --> 03:00:00,293
Frodo?

1502
03:00:07,425 --> 03:00:09,969
I know why you seek solitude.

1503
03:00:10,678 --> 03:00:14,140
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1504
03:00:14,932 --> 03:00:17,977
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1505
03:00:19,562 --> 03:00:22,190
There are other ways, Frodo.

1506
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:26,235
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1507
03:00:26,486 --> 03:00:30,239
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1508
03:00:30,490 --> 03:00:33,576
Warning? Against what?

1509
03:00:33,743 --> 03:00:35,870
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1510
03:00:36,079 --> 03:00:39,707
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1511
03:00:39,957 --> 03:00:43,711
- Don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1512
03:00:45,505 --> 03:00:48,841
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1513
03:00:50,385 --> 03:00:52,470
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1514
03:00:53,679 --> 03:00:57,350
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1515
03:00:59,185 --> 03:01:02,522
What chance do you think you have?

1516
03:01:02,688 --> 03:01:07,360
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1517
03:01:07,610 --> 03:01:11,280
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1518
03:01:13,408 --> 03:01:15,535
You fool!

1519
03:01:15,701 --> 03:01:19,705
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1520
03:01:19,872 --> 03:01:22,708
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1521
03:01:22,875 --> 03:01:24,210
- Give it to me!
- No!

1522
03:01:24,377 --> 03:01:26,212
- Give it to me!
- No.

1523
03:01:33,886 --> 03:01:35,888
I see your mind.

1524
03:01:36,139 --> 03:01:39,058
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1525
03:01:39,267 --> 03:01:41,144
You will betray us!

1526
03:01:41,394 --> 03:01:44,564
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1527
03:01:45,022 --> 03:01:48,651
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1528
03:01:55,741 --> 03:01:57,243
Frodo?

1529
03:02:01,581 --> 03:02:03,166
Frodo.

1530
03:02:07,086 --> 03:02:09,088
What have I done?

1531
03:02:09,297 --> 03:02:11,048
Please, Frodo.

1532
03:02:11,257 --> 03:02:13,926
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1533
03:03:02,475 --> 03:03:03,893
Frodo?

1534
03:03:05,144 --> 03:03:08,231
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1535
03:03:08,481 --> 03:03:10,233
Stay away!

1536
03:03:14,487 --> 03:03:18,324
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1537
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,503
Would you destroy it?

1538
03:03:35,508 --> 03:03:37,426
Voice of the ring: Aragorn.

1539
03:03:40,846 --> 03:03:43,182
Aragorn.

1540
03:03:45,017 --> 03:03:46,852
Elessar.

1541
03:03:54,527 --> 03:03:57,863
I would have gone with you to the end.

1542
03:03:58,531 --> 03:04:01,367
Into the very fires of mordor.

1543
03:04:04,704 --> 03:04:05,871
I know.

1544
03:04:08,374 --> 03:04:13,796
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1545
03:04:17,550 --> 03:04:19,302
Go, Frodo!

1546
03:05:01,218 --> 03:05:02,970
Find the halfling!

1547
03:05:04,597 --> 03:05:07,141
Find the halfling!

1548
03:05:18,778 --> 03:05:20,363
Aragorn, go!

1549
03:05:42,051 --> 03:05:43,386
Frodo!

1550
03:05:43,969 --> 03:05:45,554
Hide here. Quick!

1551
03:05:46,180 --> 03:05:47,640
Come on!

1552
03:05:50,142 --> 03:05:52,144
What's he doing?

1553
03:05:56,399 --> 03:05:58,401
He's leaving.

1554
03:06:10,996 --> 03:06:13,332
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1555
03:06:13,916 --> 03:06:17,002
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1556
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:19,004
- Over here!
- This way!

1557
03:06:29,849 --> 03:06:32,184
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1558
03:07:27,573 --> 03:07:30,618
- The horn of gondor.
- Boromir.

1559
03:11:51,879 --> 03:11:54,923
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1560
03:11:55,257 --> 03:11:57,342
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1561
03:11:59,219 --> 03:12:00,637
I let Frodo go.

1562
03:12:01,346 --> 03:12:03,932
Then you did what I could not.

1563
03:12:04,933 --> 03:12:08,270
I tried to take the ring from him.

1564
03:12:08,771 --> 03:12:13,067
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1565
03:12:13,275 --> 03:12:15,569
I did not see it.

1566
03:12:15,778 --> 03:12:18,947
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1567
03:12:19,406 --> 03:12:21,950
You fought bravely.

1568
03:12:22,242 --> 03:12:24,912
You have kept your honor.

1569
03:12:25,454 --> 03:12:27,414
Leaveit

1570
03:12:27,748 --> 03:12:29,792
it is over.

1571
03:12:30,959 --> 03:12:36,256
The world of men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1572
03:12:36,673 --> 03:12:39,676
And my city to ruin.

1573
03:12:43,764 --> 03:12:46,475
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1574
03:12:46,642 --> 03:12:50,646
But I swear to you,
I will not let the white city fall...

1575
03:12:51,647 --> 03:12:54,149
Nor our people fail.

1576
03:12:55,150 --> 03:12:56,485
Our people.

1577
03:13:00,322 --> 03:13:02,449
Our people.

1578
03:13:24,179 --> 03:13:27,182
I would have followed you, my brother.

1579
03:13:28,725 --> 03:13:30,727
My captain.

1580
03:13:33,355 --> 03:13:35,315
My king.

1581
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:57,212
Be at peace...

1582
03:13:57,546 --> 03:13:59,548
Son of gondor.

1583
03:14:16,064 --> 03:14:19,401
They will look for his coming
from the white tower.

1584
03:14:19,902 --> 03:14:22,905
But he will not return.

1585
03:15:07,574 --> 03:15:10,827
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1586
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:15,123
I wish none of this had happened.

1587
03:15:18,085 --> 03:15:20,837
So do all who live
to see such times...

1588
03:15:21,046 --> 03:15:24,466
But that is not for them to decide.

1589
03:15:24,633 --> 03:15:27,302
All you have to decide...

1590
03:15:27,552 --> 03:15:32,307
Is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1591
03:16:01,128 --> 03:16:03,171
Frodo, no!

1592
03:16:05,841 --> 03:16:08,510
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1593
03:16:12,014 --> 03:16:14,016
Go back, Sam!

1594
03:16:14,516 --> 03:16:18,103
- I'm going to mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1595
03:16:18,312 --> 03:16:21,148
And I'm coming with you!

1596
03:16:21,606 --> 03:16:24,026
You can't swim!

1597
03:17:17,371 --> 03:17:20,082
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1598
03:17:20,415 --> 03:17:24,753
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, samwise gamgee."

1599
03:17:25,879 --> 03:17:28,465
And I don't mean to.

1600
03:17:28,757 --> 03:17:30,926
I don't mean to.

1601
03:17:49,277 --> 03:17:50,946
Come on.

1602
03:18:19,433 --> 03:18:23,979
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1603
03:18:38,827 --> 03:18:43,832
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1604
03:18:47,294 --> 03:18:52,174
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1605
03:19:04,019 --> 03:19:07,189
Not if we hold true to each other.

1606
03:19:08,523 --> 03:19:13,028
We will not abandon merry and pippin
to torment and death.

1607
03:19:14,029 --> 03:19:19,284
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1608
03:19:20,535 --> 03:19:22,579
We travel light.

1609
03:19:22,787 --> 03:19:24,706
Let us hunt some orc.

1610
03:19:48,688 --> 03:19:50,106
Mordor.

1611
03:19:50,732 --> 03:19:54,110
I hope the others find a safer road.

1612
03:19:55,070 --> 03:19:57,614
Strider will look after them.

1613
03:19:58,573 --> 03:20:01,910
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1614
03:20:02,244 --> 03:20:04,704
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1615
03:20:04,913 --> 03:20:06,414
We may.

1616
03:20:13,213 --> 03:20:15,840
I'm glad you are with me.
